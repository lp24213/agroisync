## 2. PROJECT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

The project has multiple frontend implementations:
- /frontend - React (react-scripts) - Main SPA application
- /frontend-next - Next.js - SSR/SSG implementation
- /backend - Node.js/Express API

## 3. DETECTED ISSUES TO FIX

### High Priority:
- Unused variables in multiple components
- Need to verify SSR/SSG implementation in frontend-next
- API routes need testing for 5xx errors
- Security headers configuration
- Console errors audit needed

### Medium Priority:
- SEO meta tags validation
- Forms validation and submission
- Database connection validation
- Accessibility improvements

### Low Priority:
- Performance optimizations
- Code cleanup

## 4. NEXT STEPS

1. Fix React lint warnings
2. Audit frontend-next SSR implementation
3. Test backend API routes
4. Run Puppeteer for console errors
5. Implement security headers
6. SEO audit and fixes
7. Accessibility improvements
8. Lighthouse audit

Status: Ready to begin fixes

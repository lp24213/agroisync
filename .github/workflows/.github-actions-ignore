# GitHub Actions Warnings Suppression
# This file documents expected warnings and their resolution

## Expected Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

### Context Access Warnings
The following warnings are expected and safe to ignore when secrets are properly configured:

- "Context access might be invalid: ORG_ID" (RESOLVED - No longer used)
- "Context access might be invalid: PROJECT_ID" (RESOLVED - No longer used)

### Why These Warnings Appeared
These warnings appeared because GitHub Actions cannot verify that the secrets exist at parse time.
This was normal behavior and did not indicate an actual problem.

### Resolution
✅ **FIXED:** Removed ORG_ID and PROJECT_ID dependencies
✅ **SIMPLIFIED:** Now only requires VERCEL_TOKEN

1. Configure the required secret in GitHub repository settings:
   - Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add: VERCEL_TOKEN

2. The workflows include validation steps that will fail early if the secret is missing

### Workflow Validation
Both workflows include validation steps that check for the required secret:
- If VERCEL_TOKEN is missing, the workflow will fail with clear error messages
- If VERCEL_TOKEN is present, the workflow will proceed normally

## Required Secret
- VERCEL_TOKEN: Vercel access token (only secret needed)

## Testing
To test if the secret is properly configured:
1. Push to main branch
2. Check GitHub Actions tab
3. Look for "Validate secrets" step
4. Should show "✅ VERCEL_TOKEN is configured"

## Benefits of Simplification
- ✅ No more warnings about ORG_ID/PROJECT_ID
- ✅ Simpler configuration (only 1 secret needed)
- ✅ Vercel CLI automatically detects org and project
- ✅ More reliable deployment process
